## Getting started

The simplest way to get started is with the `render` method, which takes a template string and a data object (the "context").

```js
const { render } = require('dry');

// render is async
render('Hello, {{ name }}!', { name: 'Brian' })
  .then(output => {
    console.log(output);
    //=> Hello, Brian!
  });
```

Using the code above, you can do almost everything you need to do with Dry.

**Tags, Filters, Variables, and more!**

See the docs for [Shopify's Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/basics/introduction/) to learn about all of the features in the Liquid templating language. If you can do it with Liquid, you should be able to do it with Dry. _(and if you can't do it with Dry, it's a bug, and we kindly ask that you please create an issue, thanks!)_


## Full Documentation

Docs are on the way. In the meantime, you can use [this Liquid docs](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/basics/introduction/) to learn about all language features, and use the code snippet above to render your templates!


## 2.0 Notes

ðŸŽ‰  This release took a while. Here are some highlights!

**First things first**

I'm back! I know I haven't been around a lot lately, but all of that is about to change! Thank you to @doowb all of my sponsors and friends on GitHub who have provided the encouragement and support I needed to begin making this comeback.

Please consider following me and this repository to receive updates, and consider contributing to Dry so we can make this the most powerful templating library in Node.js!

**Why Dry? Aren't React and Vue the future?**

Yes, yes they are. Dry doesn't compete with them. We use Dry the same way Shopify and Jekyll use Liquid, many end-users don't know how to write JavaScript, and many developers would prefer not to write JavaScript - I love writing JavaScript, and I enjoy Vue and React, but there is something satisfying about deploying a site in 5 minutes using plain text html templates. We also use Dry to design and render email templates, configuration-based system messages, and so on.

**What's different about Dry?**

Dry is A Superset of Shopify's Liquid with first-class support for template inheritance (ahem... so you don't have to repeat yourself. So it's "dry". I know... it's all I have at the moment).

**Highlights of this PR**

- Ported directly from [Shopify/liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid) - Wherever possible, and practical, I attempted to retain the same structure and code decisions as Shopify's Liquid. Since Ruby has a number of language features that aren't available in JavaScript, I had to find arounds or do things differently in a few places.
- Powerful template inheritance: layouts, extends, blocks, macros, embed, imports, and even complex reassignments like `{\\% from 'fields' import input as input_field, textarea %}`
- More than 750 unit tests so far
- Filters: >70 filters, including **all Liquid filters** and more
- Tags: >30 Tags, including **all Liquid tags** and a several new ones! See the list below!
- More powerful comparisons and conditionals (more about this soon!)

Lots more!
